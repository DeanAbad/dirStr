                <ul>
                    <li>Since yesterday in the evening, the Internet connection came back, and so I worked with the <kbd>escape()</kbd> and <kbd>unescape()</kbd> functions, as Intellisense tells that they are already depreciated (although <b>not fully</b>); I changed them into <kbd>encodeURI()</kbd> and <kbd>decodeURI()</kbd> respectively.</li>
                    <li>Thanks to the Internet, I was able to get some good stuff at Stack Overflow and MDN Web Docs with regex; now the converter checks for regex first.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h2>Why make it?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>There are times when I need the escaped string of directory to paste on certain apps, so this tool is good for that. Although, certainly, there are already countless apps out there which are superior than mine, but I am reviewing JavaScript and wanted to build it, so I did.</li>
                    <li>To test and apply what I have learned with freeCodeCamp's <i>Responsive Web Design</i> course, and see how far I have recalled or at least understood legitimately.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>It has been 3 days already and there is still no Internet connection. As such, the work on projects was disrupted, especially on the <i>GDScript highlight.js</i>. Even without the Internet, there are still books here which I used. Still, as books they are, they were a bit outdated; even so, I was able to learn a few things.</li>
                            <li>While coding this, I was listening to <i>Mechvibes</i>. This is my first time using it, and I guess it has this placebo effect in which I was able to focus more on my work. I just love the sounds of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">loud</span> typing.</li>
                            <li><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Bored as hell</span> even though I have played some retro games to freshen my mind with game development, I still lack the motivation to do the job; I am still feeling out of place due to the lack of information from around the globe, and also due to the absence of communication means to the few I converse with. By creating something, the feeling of incompleteness is temporarily filled.</li>
